LED Knuckle Busters, light up your fists!
By Ben Lampert

Designed and manufactured by Ben Lampert at Chicago's mHub maker space (https://mhubchicago.com/) these LED's brass knuckles are a fun toy to play with. Conductive finger holes turn on high gain transistors that lights up LED's based on the strength of the grip; just put your fingers through the hole and squeeze!
Features:
Brass knuckle finger spacing fits most adults and children.
100% Analog circuitry features low power operation when not in use.
Touch sensitive design, just make a fist to turn on the LED's!
Requires:
Blue LED Brass Knuckle board (.brd files available)
Parts http://www.digikey.com/short/q8q7pt
Specs
Height: Approx 115mm
Width: Approx 50mm
Powered by two coin cell batteries


Build Log for the Brass Knuckles:

The LED Knuckle Buster mechanical and board outline was originally inspired by this thingiverse brass knuckle.
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1160010

I decided to make an LED version, and after downloading used solidworks to create and exporting a DXF of the outer perimeter of the model. This DXF was then important as layer 20 (board outline) in eagle to create the PCB board outline.



Circuit:

The circuit I think it pretty clever. I originally thought to use a microcontroller and a technique similar to the mAkey mAkey (https://makeymakey.com/). However, it seems like I put MCUâ€™s on everything these days, so I revisited a 100% analog design.

What I came up with I think it simple and clever. The copper on the backside of the board is a VCC plan, as the fingers extend through the holes that make contact with the base of a darlignton pair. Given you skin resistivity is ~100k (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763825/) you get a small amount of current running through your fingers.

Just as a ballpark, that current using a Darlington Pair is approximately:
IFinger= Vcc-VBERSkin
IFinger6V-1.4V100k
IFinger46uA

Reviewing the cheapest Darlington Pair NPN available on Digikey

This has a gain of 5,000-10,000. So our 46uA base current becomes 23-46mA of current. Not bad for small leakage through your finger!

That current is plenty to turn on a LED, so with that in mind this is the final circuit I designed.





Rev A:
Forgot to connect the via for VCC to connect to the other side of the board, whoop!
Also, forgot a pull down on the base which caused FING4 LED to always be on.

Rev B:
Everything is tested ok! Time to Ship It!
